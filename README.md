# RED-E
Regional Evolutionary Distinctiveness and Endangerment R Code

This was my first ever coding project that was a part of my MS thesis. 

The bird code looped through a .tree data source, which held 10,000 possible 
evolutionary trees to show how closely related different bird species are.

The birds that were outside of the US were trimmed from the tree and 1000 of
the trees were looped through to find the average Evolutionary Distinctivess 
value for each species. 

For mammals, we only had 3 trees from which to calculate the Evolutinary 
Distinctiveness value, but the process was much the same as the bird script.
